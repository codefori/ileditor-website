Code Coverage allows the users to determine which lines of code were and were not executed.

The Code Coverage Pro features comes with it's own panel in VS Code (as shown in the screenshot). This panel will show a list of Coverage Tests you have created. At the top of the view, there are two buttons:

* `+` (add) which is used to create a new Coverage Test
* a re-run icon, which will rerun any of the tests are showing their results. This button allows you to run multiple tests at once.

Click the add button will show a new dialog, where you can provide information for the test:

1. Name of the test
2. Command to execute in the test. For example: `CALL LIB/PGM`
3. Program for coverage to check. Usually the program you are calling.
4. A binding directory. If you are calling a program that calls a service program (or many service programs), you should specify the binding directory which contains those programs for them to be included in the coverage result.

Note that for Code Coverage to work you need to make sure

1. that `QDEVTOOLS` is on your library list.
2. the correct PTFs are installed (which are free).
