To edit streamfiles, you can use the IFS Browser. The default folder that will be displayed is your users home directory.

When you click on a directory, it will load all directories and files below it. The file extension correlates to which syntax highlighting is used. When you click on a streamfile, it should open up in a tab where the code can then be edited.

You are able to right-click on directories and streamfiles which will show you the related context menus.

You can save with Ctrl + S / Command + S, plus all regular editing shortcuts can be used (like undo, redo, etc).
