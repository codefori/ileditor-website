Code for IBM i officially supports the following IBM i versions:

- 7.2
- 7.3
- 7.4

With that being said, some features are backwards compatible. Use this table to determine feature support:

| Feature        | Info                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IFS Browser    | Should always work.                                                             |
| Object Browser | Should always work.                                                             |
| Git Client     | The git client requires git\* installed on the IBM i you're connected to.       |
| Member Editor  | Should always work. Requires db2util\* and Source Dates extension to retain source dates.                  |

_\* can be installed via the yum package manager, which is supported by IBM on IBM i 7.2 and above._
