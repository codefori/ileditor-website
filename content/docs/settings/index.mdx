![A screenshot showing the settings panel](./settings.png)

This is the settings window. On the left is a list of different configurable settings, and the more-right group is where the selected setting can be edited.

### SPF Shortcuts

This list is the list of members which will be displayed in the Member Browser panel. For example, if you wanted to edit source in `DEVLIB/QRPGLESRC`, then you should add it to the list first. The order in which the items are will be reflected in the panel also.

### Compile Settings

The compile settings is a JSON editor in which the compile options are stored.

- Top-level properties are for the type of extension (like `RPGLE` or `CLLE`)
- The next object down from that is for the file system type - either `QSYS` (source members) or `IFS` (streamfiles)
- The type object is a key-value list of compile options and their command.

When you install ILEditor 2, there will already be default properties.

### Library List

This will let you change the library list for compilations (and other things). You can add, remove and re-order items in this list.

### Home Directory

The home directory is the directory that will be used in the IFS Browser as the root but will also be the jobs working directory when building from the IFS. The home directory is also used in the git plugin as the working git repository.

### Build Library

This library is used to build objects into when building source code out of the IFS.

### QSYS ASP

The ASP name here is used if you store your source code in a different ASP which is not the default. This is only needed for source code in members.

### Temp Library

ILEditor 2 needs a temp library to store information for your working session. If there are multiple people in a company using ILEditor 2, it is recommended that they all share the same Temp Library. This library can be cleared regularly as may build up in storage, preferably when no one is working.

It is common to use a scheduled job to do this:

```
ADDJOBSCDE JOB(ILECLEAN) 
           CMD(CLRLIB LIB(ILEDITOR)) 
           FRQ(*WEEKLY) SCDDATE(*NONE) 
           SCDDAY(*ALL) SCDTIME('23:59:59') 
           TEXT('Clear ILEditor 2 temporary data')
```
