To edit source members, you can use the Member Browser.

**To add items to the list**, there press the 'Add source file' button at the top of the Member Browser view.

When you click on a source file, it will load a list of members inside of it along with it's associated extension. The extension correlates to which syntax highlighting is used. When you click on a source member, it should open up in a tab where the code can then be edited.

You are able to right-click on source files and members which will show you the related context menus.

You can save with Ctrl + S / Command + S, plus all regular editing shortcuts can be used (like undo, redo, etc).

## ASP support

You can supply an ASP name if your source file is not in the default ASP. This is only needed if you do not have Source Date support enabled, because that uses a different mechanism to fetch the content of members.

You can either:

1. Install `db2util` and let Code for IBM i determine which ASP the source member is in. This method also requires 7.3 and above.
2. Specify the source ASP in the Code for IBM i settings.
