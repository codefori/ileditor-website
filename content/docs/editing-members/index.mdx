![A screenshot showing a member being edited](./editing-members.png)

To edit source members, you can use the Member Browser. If you read the Settings page, you should know that for source physical-files to display in this list they need to be added in the Settings for ILEditor 2.

When you click on a source physical-file, it will load a list of members inside of it along with it's associated extension. The extension correlates to which syntax highlighting is used. When you click on a source member, it should open up in a tab where the code can then be edited.

You are able to right-click on source physical-files and members which will show you the related context menus.

You can save with Ctrl + S / Command + S, plus all regular editing shortcuts can be used (like undo, redo, etc).

**Note: as of the initial release of ILEditor 2, the `SRCDAT` column is not retained.** This documentation will be updated accordingly when it is implemented to save & update the column.
